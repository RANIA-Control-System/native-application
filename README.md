# ✍️ Design Focus
## ♿️ Accessibility (a11y)
Since the main audience for the RANIA Control System (RCS) is intended to be those of advanced age, special attention should be taken towards accessibility. Special functionality is built into React Native for this, which can be found [here](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/accessibility). You can learn more about accessibility and what exactly that means [here](https://a11yproject.com/about/)

_Special attention should be given to our accessible implementation in the final presentation; it's a big deal in tech, especially with out audience._

## 🚦Ease of Use
Every part of the design and implementation should ensure that the application is as easy to use as possible. This means things should be simple, and easily understandable for someone that isn't accustomed to tech. No swiping to open side menus, advanced gestures, etc. Assume everyone using the application is using it for the first time.

## 🖼 Tablet-First
As we are targetting a tablet, everything should be design assuming that is what the application will be running on. Other devices will be added based on our progress & goals throughout the semester.
